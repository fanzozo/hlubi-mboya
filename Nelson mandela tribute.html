<h5>QUOTES</h5>
<p>"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white 
domination. I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which 
all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. 
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."</p>
<p>"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects
 and enhances the freedom of others."
</p>
<p>
"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
</p>
<p>
"In my country we go to prison first and then become President."</p>
